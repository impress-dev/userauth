# userauth

**Important:** The Wappler project must be in a git repo (local or remote)

To install all the necessary files used by userauth, run the following command:

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/impress-dev/userauth/main/install.sh | sh -s "<path to Wappler project>"
```

Note: This has been tested on a Mac only - volunteers are welcome to create install steps/scripts for other platforms
